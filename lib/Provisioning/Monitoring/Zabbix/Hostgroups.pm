=head1 Synopsis

use Zabbixapi::Hostgroups;

=head2 Methods

=over

=item initHostgroups 

This method initialises some often used values in the module. I.e. a new json rpc client, the zabbix version (e.g. '2.0'), the authentication ID and the zabbix API url.
This method needs to be called before using any other method in the module, it's similar to a constructor in OO programming.

=item createHostGroup 

Creates a new hostgroup with the given name. Returns the ID of the created hostgroup and '0' on failure.

=item deleteHostGroup

Deletes the hostgroup with the given id. Returns the id of the deleted hostgroup on success and '0' on failure.

=item getHostGroupID

Returns the hostgroup ID corresponding to a given name. Or '0' on failure.

=item existNameHostGroup

=item existIDHostGroup

=item listHostgroups

Returns all hostgroups that exist on the Zabbix server or '0' on failure.
