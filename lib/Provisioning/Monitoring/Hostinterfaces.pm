=head2 Methods

=over

=item initHostinterfaces 

This method initialises some often used values in the module. I.e. a new json rpc client, the zabbix version (e.g. '2.0'), the authentication ID and the zabbix API url.
This method needs to be called before using any other method in the module, it's similar to a constructor in OO programming.

=item createHostInterface 

Creates a new host interface for a given host (id), ip address and port number. Returns the ID of the created host interface and '0' on failure.

=item deleteHostInterface

Deletes the host interface with the given id. Returns the id of the deleted host interface on success and '0' on failure.

=item getHostInterface

Returns all Host Interface properties for a Host Interface with a given ID. Or '0' on failure.
